1. Installing of git on the linux instance (yum install git)
2. Clone backup-utils file inside linux instance (git clone backup-utils)
3. loading of the *.pem to the .ssh in home directory of Linux instance (GHE instance pem file)
4. Configure backup.config file file by replacing the hostname and pem certificate path file.
5. Add the authorized_keys to the ssh key in the GHE instance (it will be in home folder)
6. Check for connection b/w the backup instance & GHE instance (bin/ghe-host-check)(inside backup-utils directory)
7. Then if the connection is OK start the backup (bin/ghe-backup)
8. To restore to another GHE instance(restore instance) generate a new ssh key in linux instance and paste it over 2nd GHE instance(restore instance)
9. Restore should be done on the backup instance by providing following command {bin/ghe-restore -c (GHE instance ip) }


notes: 1)If any command return error as permission denied use "sudo" command.
       2)The restore instance will be pointing to the primary instance IP, Inorder to resolve this change the hostname(DNS entries) and delete the SSH key of the          primary instance & save settings.
       3)To reach any instance use respective instance hostname/setup url (In case of site can't be reached)
       4)Inorder to generate public keys from pem use PuTTygen.
